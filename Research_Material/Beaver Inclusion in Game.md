This document will include potential ways to incorporate information about beavers into the game. 

Passive ways will include gameplay features or specific moments to occur during gameplay. 

Active ways will be things to include as dialogue, tooltips or other text-based interactive content. 

## Passive Ways

* Castor is a beaver excretion that is used to scent mark territory, and should be a key piece in navigating the beaver village.

* Beavers normally can hold their breath 5-6 minutes underwater, but they have an absolute maximum of 15 minutes. This can be used in the underwater section as a timer, or in a cutscene where our main beaver has to survive for a long time underwater.

* The reason the beaver has a hard time building a dam is going to be because the river is much steeper than beavers like to build dams in, perhaps about 15 degrees rather than 1-5 degrees. 

* Because beavers normally move out at 2 years old, the main beaver should be 2 years old when the game starts.   
  * Some beavers in the village should be older than 2 yet living with their original family unit, because it is a high population density area

* A beaver family unit will normally consist of 2 kits, 2 yearlings and 2 adults. This may be different in our game because of our high-population density scenario. 

* Beavers will wash the bedding of sticks, twigs and organic material that make up the inside of their lodge, and this should be reflected in a small scene where a mother beaver instructs her yearlings to wash the bedding.

* In the beavers first attempt at building a dam, this should be one of the things that fails as they try  
  * “While the parents dredged up mud from the pond bottom near the dam and added it to the dam, a youngster also dived and picked up mud, but much farther from the dam. Mud in paws, the young beaver swam to the dam, leaving a wake of muddy water. He arrived at the dam empty-handed.”

## Active Ways

Some potential textual options to include in the game

**Interactive** \- A wad of cash will be on the side of one of the beaver dams, and this will pull up a dialogue bubble when interacted with.   
“Weird stuff can appear in beaver dams\! In Louisiana, after money was stolen from a casino and dumped into a river, beavers incorporated the stolen dollar bills into their dam\!”

**(Undetermined interaction)** \-   
“A beaver tail has a big clump of blood vessels at the base, allowing the beaver to shed excess heat in the summer while not draining their warmth in the winter.”

**Dialogue \-** Interacting with one of the beaver dads in the village will eventually get the dialogue  
“Kids these days\! One of our two year olds won’t leave the lodge because he claims ‘the lodge market is terrible’. The state of things\!”   
*Alternatively*  
“Kids these days\! I can’t believe our two-year old isn’t moving out just because there is no space for a new lodge\! When I was his age I built this lodge when I had nothing but two sticks to my name\!” 

**Item or Interactive** \- Either the tooltip for a fish item, or a dialogue pop-up for a dead fish on the ground that you can interact with  
	“Beavers share more in common with fish than you might think. Back in the 1700’s they were classified as fish because of their scaly tail\! This was mainly so they could be eaten on fasting days.”

**Item** \- Clump of fur, which has the tooltip  
	“Beavers have an insane amount of hair\! Just one square centimeter patch of their skin can contain 23,000 hairs\!”

## Miscellaneous Dialogue

**Tutorial Section**

*Inside Bobo’s parents house*  
*\[Goal: Establish Bobo as slightly lazy for a beaver.\]*

Bobo’s Mom \- “Bobo, can you please wash the bedding? It’s been almost a week and you still haven't done it\!” {Beavers actually wash the bedding of their lodges}

Bobo \- “OK mom, I’ll get to it, just give me a minute.”

Bobo’s Mom \- “Bobo, you’ve been saying that this whole time. Go wash the bedding now, please.”

Bobo \- “Fine. Ugh, I’ll do it.”

(Washes the bedding)

*\_\_\_\_\_\_*  
*Starts in Bobo’s Parents house, transitions to outside*  
*\[Goal: Establish that most beavers move out at 2, but some stay longer\]*

Bobo’s Dad \- “Hey bud, can you go fetch some extra sticks from the Loggertons? I can hear a leak and it's been driving me mad.” {This is a reference to the fact that Beavers sense leaks via hearing}

*Bobo swims out to the loggerton’s lodge*

Loggerton Kits \- “Hey Bobo\! Are you here to play with us?”

Bobo \- “Sorry kiddos, but I am on an errand from my dad.”  
“Mrs.Loggerton, do you have any sticks I can borrow? My dad found a leak in our lodge.”

Mrs. Loggerton \- “Oh, I think we have something lying around. Let me go fetch some from our stash.” (Dives underwater)

Chip Loggerton (Surfaces) \- “Oh hey Bobo. Haven’t seen you in a while, getting pretty close to your 2nd birthday aren’t you? Are you excited to move out?” {Beavers normally move out after 2 years}

Bobo \- “Oh I don’t know Chip, I mean you didn’t move out and you’re almost 3\! Can’t I just stay with my parents?”

Chip \- “You know that barely ever happens, my parents just needed my help to take care of the kits after they had a large litter. You should be preparing to move out, I know I’m ready to strike off on my own.”

Bobo \- “If you say so…” 

*Maybe cut here?*  
**\_\_\_\_\_\_**

*Bobo’s Second Birthday*  
*\[Goal: Send off Bobo, show that he is unprepared to leave\]*

Bobo’s Dad \- “Are you excited Bobo? Today is finally the day you get to go off and start your own family.”

Bobo’s Mom \- “Bobo, I’m gonna miss you, but I know you’ll be alright. Just always remember what we taught you, and jump into the river as soon as you see a predator.”

Bobo \- “I don’t know if I’m ready to leave. \*whine\* Can I just stay with you guys like Chip?”

Bobo’s Dad \- “Sorry bud, but you need to learn how to take control of your own life now. It’ll be hard at first, but I know you can stick through it.”
