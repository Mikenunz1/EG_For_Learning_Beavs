# **Section 2: Product Description**

* **Project Title**: Educational Game for Learning Beavers\!  
* **Abstract**: The Educational Game for Learning Beavers is an interactive project designed to teach players about beavers and their habitats through gameplay. Unlike traditional methods like reading or watching videos, this game aims to reach a broader audience, even those who may not already be interested in beavers. Built with the Godot game engine and using GitHub for teamwork, the game will include key features such as save/load options, inventory, player movement, sound effects and educational content. If time allows, we will also add multiplayer gameplay and NPCs that adapt to player actions. This project’s goal is to make learning about wildlife ecosystems both fun and educational.   
* **Goal:** Our project will create an educational game which seeks to teach the user/player about beavers through game mechanics, story, and flavor text. This will not only be about entertaining the player but also sourced, educational content through playing the game. The game will follow similar principles to games made by companies like Brainpop and Leapfrog. We’d be developing this game for a general audience, potentially michiking the style of edutainment games we grew up with, but with a heavier focus on game content. 

* **Current Practice:** The traditional way educational content is taught is through reading, videos or other classes. This is limited in that it normally only teaches those who already have interest in the subject.  
* **Novelty:** Compared to traditional education content, our game would reach people beyond the normal audience who would want to learn about beavers. The game is geared to be entertaining without the educational content, so someone may play the game for fun and end up becoming interested in learning more about beavers and the environment.  
* **Effects:** Give users an informative and entertaining way to understand more about the pond/river/stream wildlife ecosystem.  
* **Technical Approach**: We will use the Godot game engine for the majority of this project.  We will use GitHub as our version control system.  Sound design and music creation will be done using FL Studio as a Digital Audio Workstation.  Pixel  
* **Risks:**  Many of us are completely new to Godot and game development in its entirety.  To be successful, we will need to adequately learn both the software and the discipline.  To mitigate this risk, our experienced members will help the less experienced members.  Furthermore, they will include resources (online teaching for the tools we will be using) to ensure everyone is ready.

# **Section 2: Non-functional Requirements**

* **Usability:** The controls will follow expected standards, such as W-A-S-D for movement so that the game feels familiar to users. The GUI will be simple so that it clearly displays any relevant information to the user.   
* **Performance:** The game should produce at least 30 frames per second on machines with the minimum specifications.   
* **Scalability:** The multiplier function should maintain optimal performance and reliability as the user base grows, ensuring scalability

# 

# **Section 3: External Requirements**

* **Reliability:** The game should achieve reliability by avoiding any crashes, regardless of user input.  If a player attempts to exit the map or otherwise generate unexpected behavior, there should be sufficient countermeasures to prevent them.   
* **Accessibility:** We can upload the final game to itch.io or a similar indie game service in order to let people install the game easily. If a user wanted to build our game from source, they could download a version from our Repo and use the Godot engine to build and run a programmable version on their machine. Lastly, we plan to build the game with different accessibility features in mind such as alternative controller support, resizable text, and proper text contrast  
* **Scope:** The scope of this game is scalable because we can adjust the length of the game easily.  If it seems like the group is progressing too slowly to meet our initial plans, we are capable of culling certain game elements so that it can be completed within the time frame.  If it seems that we are progressing too quickly, the style of the game allows us to add additional features.

# **Section 4: Team Process Description**

## **Software Tool Set Justification:** 

Godot: Godot will be the primary tool used for our game development. Godot is a fantastic tool for game development as it’s open-source, routinely updated, and has a wide community of support. The built in IDE makes it easy for our programmers to work on the project. Godot is not resource intensive which means it’s compatible with all of our machines. It also supports cross-platform development so that we can work with windows and apple computers. Lastly Godot is distributed under the MIT license which allows us to produce games and distribute them as long as we attribute Godot as the engine. 

Github: We will be using Github for our version control system. We are choosing it not only because it’s a requirement for class but also because it has great integration with Godot. Godot has built in version control with Git, and thus it was easy to set up our repository with very few extra steps. 

Discord: Discord is an accessible communication program because creating an account and server is free.  It is effective at splitting topics into various text channels, which will help us differentiate between important aspects of our team work.  

FL Studio: This is a Digital Audio Workstation that all music and sound design for the game will be conducted in.  Grant already has a full license for this software and several years of experience using it, so it makes sense to take advantage of the resource.  Furthermore, FL Studio has a free, unlimited trial version that is accessible to other group members if they need to access it.  

Pixilart: Pixilart is an online drawing editor that will be used to make the visual content for our game. It is free to use and accessible through any web browser, and has complimentary apps on Google Play and the App Store for both iOS and Android. It is a robust and in-depth editor that allows our group to create objects, backdrops, and sprites that make up the visual medium of our game. Being free and accessible to all group members makes it a good tool for our visual design. 

##  **Roles Justification:** 

**Grant** is the Sound Designer and Data flow manager, which are two different and important roles. Having a data flow manager will help everyone in the project better understand the whole system, and design and develop accordingly. Grant is suited to this role because he has experience from Software engineering 1, as well as with Canva, which is the tool he will use to model the data.  
He is also the Sound Designer, which brings the actions of the game together, and overall improves the experience of the player. Without engaging the player with sound, they may get bored and leave the game without learning about beavers or enjoying the game. Grant is suited for this role because he has experience in sound design and already owns licenses and has experience with a variety of sound design tools. 

**Grant’s** Schedule:

* Week 3 1/24: Record and add at least 5 sound assets to the GitHub repository.  Also, create the initial data flow chart based on the current game status. Complete Track-1 (for the menu music).    
* Week 4 1/31: Add another 5 sound assets to the repository.  Complete Track-2 (forest area)  
* Week 5 2/7: Fully implement a method that switches music tracks when a new area reached by the player.  
* Week 6 2/14: Fully implement a method that plays sound effects on contact with map objects.   
* Week 7 2/21: Incorporate all sound effects into the appropriate hit-box method and incorporate all musical tracks into the corresponding map areas.   
* Week 8 2/28: Create a Google sheet and a corresponding Google form to collect playtest feedback.    
* Week 9 3/7: Update data flow documentation now that most methods should be clearly established.   
* Week 10 3/14: Finalize and publish data flow documentation to the GitHub repository. 

**Jacob** is the lead artist, which is essential to the playability of the game. Without art, virtually nobody would play the game, and it would meet none of its use case scenarios. Jacob is suited to this role because he has creative inspiration regarding the subject of the game, an interest in pixel art, and a willingness to learn these new skills for the sake of the project. 

**Jacob’s** Schedule 

* Week 3 1/24: Generate first character sprite concept and potentially primary design. Make a List of major in-game items/scenes that will need to be generated. Begin and set up the basic structure of the game map. Create placeholder assets, items, and UI to allow functionality testing.  
* Week 4 1/31: Finalize character design and create 1st half of known assets and game items including NPC’s. Refine game map. Set up a test area to allow work on character interaction and times.  
* Week 5 2/7: Work on text box style/display allowing for text use and implementation into game. Adjust the game map to further reflect any design choices made or changed on it. Create 2nd half of in game assets, items, and NPC’s.  
* Week 6 2/14: Finish all previous work and add detail and design to make products more visually polished. Adjust the game map to reflect changes and feedback. Create basic structure for first half of minigames  
* Week 7 2/21: Advance final design for half of the environment and levels for mini-games. Begin base design for 2nd half of environments/ minigames.  
* Week 8 2/28 : Adjust any details of environments/levels for all mini-games. Advance to final design of 2nd half of environments/ minigames  
* Week 9 3/7: Finalize design of environments and add additional assets based on work requirements. Begin final artistic details and requirements to make the game more aesthetically pleasing.  
* Week 10 3/14: Finish final artistic details and requirements to make the game more aesthetically polished.

**Guillermo** is the Network Designer, which will handle the process of making the game multiplayer capable. Without a dedicated Network Designer, the process of making the game multiplayer would be restricted to multiple users on the same device, which would vastly limit the use cases of our game. Additionally, the role has the responsibility of making any single player code function in multiplayer, which allows the other members of the team more time to develop the core features of the game. Guillermo is a good fit for this role because he has interest in learning network processes, and he has shown the willingness and ability to learn this over the quarter. 

**Guillermo’s** Schedule 

* Week 3 1/24: Set up a basic server-client connection prototype using Godot. Create a multiplayer-specific branch on GitHub.  
* Week 4 1/31: Synchronize player movement between server and clients. Test and refine movement synchronization to ensure smooth player control.  
* Week 5 2/7: Fully implement basic multiplayer interactions (e.g., players can tag or interact with each other).  
* Week 6 2/14: Implement and test methods to synchronize sound effects for multiplayer actions. Add functionality to handle player disconnection gracefully.  
* Week 7 2/21: Introduce NPCs with basic behavior synchronized across all clients. Ensure NPC reactions to players are consistent across the network.  
* Week 8 2/28: Finalize multiplayer gameplay mechanics, ensuring all features (movement, interactions, NPCs) are functioning smoothly conduct playtesting with a small group to identify bugs and gather feedback.  
* Week 9 3/7: Perform integration tests for all multiplayer features to ensure they work together seamlessly. Update documentation to reflect the finalized multiplayer implementation.  
* Week 10 3/14: Finalize and polish all multiplayer features. Publish updated documentation to GitHub and prepare the multiplayer feature for the game’s release.

**Mike** is the Head developer, which is necessary to organize the other developers and make sure game development continues smoothly throughout the quarter. He will be the most involved in the building blocks of our code, which will allow the less experienced developers an ability to contribute and work on the project. Mike is suited for this role because he has previous experience working with game development, and specifically the tools and scripting language we will be using for the project. 

**Mike’s** Schedule 

* Week 3 1/24: Finish the player instance, the controls, and basic movement. Finish sketch of menu and in game UI. Finish setting up the resource file system, so fellow developers know where to place and organize files in the Godot section.  
* Week 4 1/31: Finish game start menu UI and functionality, also finish basic save/load/quit system that stores player location and minor progress markers  
* Week 5 2/7: Finish scene management implementation including connections to game system objects and all related components necessary to complete functionality. Also finish basic NPC navigational and interact system.   
* Week 6 2/14: Finish inventory basics, main game UI.  
* Week 7 2/21: Half of the total number of minigames are now finished.  
* Week 8 2/28: All primary requirements for the game system objects are complete, including proper system loading and saving, minigames and NPC interaction, inventory, and any other large overarching game mechanics. All minigames should be finished and complete at this point.   
* Week 9 3/7: Testing phase in which I’ll be collaborating with different portions of the team to repair bugs and issues identified during testing connecting to the main game system and individual components. We are also checking the executables at this point to ensure the game runs after being built. All developed tests will PASS at this point.  
* Week 10 3/14: Game development now moves towards post-production where I finish an Itch.io landing page, ensuring the executable is working and running on multiple machines. We also finish any promotional or documentation materials at this point. 

**Ryan** is the lead content researcher. This role is required as it is responsible for the facts and information about beavers which will inform players as they play the game. As this is one of the main purposes of the game, and vastly expands its usage scenarios, it is important that a lead researcher be present. Ryan is suitable for this role because he has done previous research projects at OSU and is willing to do the work required to learn and inform about beavers and the environment which surrounds them. 

**Ryan’s** Schedule 

* Week 3 1/24: Compile a document about beavers containing at least 3 distinct sources. Work with the rest of the team to use this information to develop the main storyline and activities of the game.   
* Week 4 1/31:  Develop at least 5 passive ways and at least 5 active ways users can see information during gameplay. Design at least 5 tests for the basic player instance and the save/load functionality.  
* Week 5 2/7: Create at least 25 potential dialogue options that inform about beavers that will go in the game. Carry out the tests developed in the previous week.  
* Week 6 2/14: Design at least 10 tests based on the User Scenarios to conduct on the game.   
* Week 7 2/21: Conduct any relevant tests (from the previous week) on the current part of the game. Identify at least 3 places in the gameplay where more information (passive or active) about beavers can be included.  
* Week 8 2/28:  Research ways to link players to external resources about beavers.   
* Week 9 3/7: Design tests based on user feedback to apply to the game.   
* Week 10 3/14: Design tests for cross-platform compatibility issues. 

**Mia** is the lead environment designer, which is important in creating a cohesive and solid gameplay environment. The environment, combined with the music, will provide the correct mood for the player, making the game more enjoyable as they play. Additionally, it will help to spark interest to dig deeper into the information about beavers. Mia is a good fit for the lead environment designer because she is interested in learning more about level and map design. Mia has shown that she will spend the time required to learn about these topics, and will be able to implement them by the end of the term. 

**Mia’s** Schedule 

* Week 3 1/24: Finish collecting research from 5 credible sources on beaver habitats / environmental surroundings. Complete a general sketch of the game map.  
* Week 4 1/31: Finish sketches of mini-game environments.   
* Week 5 2/7: Finish implementing game map.   
* Week 6 2/14: Make any revisions or changes to game map based on group feedback.   
* Week 7 2/21: Finish the environments / levels for half of the mini-games.  
* Week 8 2/28: Finish the environments / levels for the all the mini-games.

## **Risks:** 

* Many of our team members are new to using Godot, so we will need to take the time to learn the software.  If we are unable to quickly adjust to the new software, it could leave us without enough time to finish the project.   
* The networking portion of multiplayer implementation is a serious challenge.  If it turns out to be too much of a challenge, the rest of the team will need to correspondingly adjust to the change.    
* Certain features that we expect to work may not be possible due to software limitations.  We may either need to cull those features, or develop alternative solutions.  This could use more resources and time than we can afford. 


## **External Feedback:**

*  We believe that external feedback would be most helpful around Week 8 assuming that we have a stable build.  As soon as a stable build is accessible, we will ask for feedback from play testers, who will be selected from group member’s friends.    
* The feedback will be acquired using a Google form that the testers will fill out after playing through the game. This should give us time to make adjustments before the final release of the game. 

## **Timeline:**

* Week 3 1/24: All planning should be completed, and game development should begin.    
* Week 4 1/31: Finalize major story elements ideation and map design.   
* Week 5 2/7: Finish map implementation, finish base NPC instances (movement, interaction, basic memory system).   
* Week 6 2/14: Finish writing and implementation of NPC Dialogue and flavor text.   
* Week 7 2/21: Multiplayer elements should be fully incorporated. Finish half of all designed minigames. (For example, if we designed 6 minigames by week 3, 3 minigames should be playable at this point).   
* Week 8 2/28: Complete a stable release to use for user feedback.  Collect user feedback data to later improve the game.   
* Week 9 3/7: Utilize the user feedback information to make adjustments to the game as needed.   
* Week 10 3/14: Complete finishing touches, and upload the game to a publicly accessible place like itch.io.
