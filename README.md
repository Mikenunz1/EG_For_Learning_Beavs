# Section 2: Product Description

* **Project Title**: Educational Game for Learning Beavers\!  
* **Abstract**: The Educational Game for Learning Beavers is an interactive project designed to teach players about beavers and their habitats through gameplay. Unlike traditional methods like reading or watching videos, this game aims to reach a broader audience, even those who may not already be interested in beavers. Built with the Godot game engine and using GitHub for teamwork, the game will include key features such as save/load options, inventory, player movement, sound effects and educational content. If time allows, we will also add multiplayer gameplay and NPCs that adapt to player actions. This project’s goal is to make learning about wildlife ecosystems both fun and educational.   
* **Goal:** Our project will create an educational game which seeks to teach the user/player about beavers through game mechanics, story, and flavor text. This will not only be about entertaining the player but also sourced, educational content through playing the game. The game will follow similar principles to games made by companies like Brainpop and Leapfrog. We’d be developing this game for a general audience, potentially michiking the style of edutainment games we grew up with, but with a heavier focus on game content.   
* **Current Practice:** The traditional way educational content is taught is through reading, videos or other classes. This is limited in that it normally only teaches those who already have interest in the subject.  
* **Novelty:** Compared to traditional education content, our game would reach people beyond the normal audience who would want to learn about beavers. The game is geared to be entertaining without the educational content, so someone may play the game for fun and end up becoming interested in learning more about beavers and the environment.  
* **Effects:** Give users an informative and entertaining way to understand more about the pond/river/stream wildlife ecosystem.  
* **Technical Approach**: We will use the Godot game engine for the majority of this project.  We will use GitHub as our version control system.   
* **Risks:**  Many of us are completely new to Godot and game development in its entirety.  To be successful, we will need to adequately learn both the software and the discipline.  To mitigate this risk, our experienced members will help the less experienced members.  Furthermore, they will include resources (online teaching for the tools we will be using) to ensure everyone is ready.
